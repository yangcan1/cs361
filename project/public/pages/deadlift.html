            The deadlift is a great way to build strong legs and butt. In a deadlift, you lift the weight from the ground to thigh-level using primarily your leg and hip muscles, but with the assistance of most of the large muscle groups of your body. The deadlift is usually performed with a bar and plates or a fixed barbell, but you can also do it with dumbbells. It is a specialty of powerlifters that you shouldn't ignore in general fitness weight training. Make the deadlift part of your strength training workouts to build muscle and functional fitness.
