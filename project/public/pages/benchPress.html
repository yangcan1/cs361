            Bench presses can be an effective exercise for building up chest, arm, and shoulder muscles. They work several different muscles in your upper body, including the chest, shoulders, and arms.
    
            A bench press is an exercise that can be used to strengthen the muscles of the upper body, including the pectorals, arms, and shoulders.
            
            Depending on your goals, there are different variations of bench presses that work slightly different muscles, too. For example, a narrower grip bench press will put extra emphasis on the triceps and forearms.            </p>
